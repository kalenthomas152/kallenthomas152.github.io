<h2>Update: Hi everyone! Just wanted to let you know of a quick update. You may notice that all the videos are off my website, I did that because after a while my website is a mess from all my videos being all over the place. So, I decided to take off my videos every year except for on the home page because those videos need to stay up. But the good news is I will still keep all my videos on Dialymotion if you want to see my older videos:) if you want to see my older videos <a href= "https://www.dailymotion.com/bestcrafts0/videos">Click Here</a>. I apologize for any inconvenience this may bring.</p>


    
    
<h3>Hi!! Welcome to my crafts webiste!! I am a 12 year old boy that loves doing crafts! And of course this webiste is all about crafts and just doing random videos! I like doing random videos because they are very fun to make and sometimes it's nice to take a little break from doing crafts and just be free to any videos I want to do:)! This website is mostly about crafts like I already said but the crafts I do are Perler Beads, 3Doodler and SO much more crafts and fun stuff! I hope you like my videos and enjoy the website! And one more thing I try my best to make eveything look professional and I apologize if anything looks wrong just let me know in the survey if anything needs to be fixed:)! THANKS AND ENJOY MY WEBSITE!!</p>
